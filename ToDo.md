# Keys #

Currently, the app is not able to find the keys.
It would be awesome if we could port MFOC to Android,
in order to find the Keys.

# Simple #

In the 'Simple'-screen,
There is not much information about the card.
Only the 'Credit' and 'Expire Date' work.
We should get more information from the card, like:
  * Date of Birth (personal card only)
  * Transaction history
  * Travel history

TODO:
  * New Layout for Simple Screen
  * More info on Simple Screen
  * The app should also work on devices without NFC (read dumps only)
